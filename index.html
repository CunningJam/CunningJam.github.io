<p>Roof top gardens and green spaces are an important and helpful cornerstone in the health of a city. The implementation of these gardens is a very important step in combating a number of downsides to city living. Not only do they offer a nice place to relax and spend time in, but they also help the environment. Rain run-off is a very common problem for the environment around the city, Urban gardens absorb some of the rain, thus removing a large amount of water run-off, and keeping it in the city. In addition to that, roof top gardens also absorb heat from the sun, shielding your building and keeping it cool and saving you money. These are just two of the many ways that roof top gardens can help you and the environment.</p>
